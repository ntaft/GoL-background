## Game of Life interactive animation

Fully interactive background / foreground animation for websites, utilizing canvas. Cell states follow the rules of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). Cells are randomly seeded at the start of the animation. 

Implementation created for use in my [portfolio site](http://www.nicktaft.com); based off of an earlier student project, [GoGoL](https://github.com/ntaft/GameOfLife)

Users can:
- Click and shift-click to activate and deactivate individual cells, respectively.
- Start/stop animation
- Step to the next generation
- Clear the board

### Tech Utilized:
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript
- Canvas
- Node & express (test server platform)

### Future plans: 
- Pre-defined / user-selectable seeding patterns that produce interesting growth patterns.
- more user controls over variables (speed, grid size, seeding density, etc.)
